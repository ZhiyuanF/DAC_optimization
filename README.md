DAC optimization / Julia / NYS-CA data

This project investgates the optimization method for Direct Air Capture (DAC) operation when exposed to power market price/carbon intensity variation

The main code (current updated to V1.0) is developed in Julia. Testing pricing data uses NYC price.
(dac_test.jl is the develping code for testing minor improvements)

Please refer to "DAC_formulation_20230531.pdf" for details of the mathematical formulation of the optimization.
